Here's a breakdown of my understanding of how they design their winning and profit logic, broken down into key components.

1. The Foundation: RNG (Random Number Generator)
Everything starts with a certified and truly random RNG. This is non-negotiable for fairness and trust.

How it works: Before you even press spin, the RNG is constantly generating thousands of random numbers per second. The moment you hit "Spin," the game takes the exact number at that millisecond to determine the outcome.

Implementation: For web games, you can use window.crypto.getRandomValues() for a cryptographically secure RNG. Never use Math.random() for a real money game as it is not secure or robust enough.

2. The Mathematical Core: RTP, Volatility, and House Edge
This is the business logic that ensures profitability.

Return to Player (RTP): This is the theoretical percentage of all wagered money that a slot will pay back to players over a very long period (millions of spins).

Example: An RTP of 96% means the game is programmed to pay back, on average, $96 for every $100 wagered. The remaining $4 is the House Edge (profit).

Jili/PG RTP: They often have RTPs ranging from 94% to 97%, sometimes configurable for different markets or operators.

Volatility (Variance):

Low Volatility: Frequent but smaller wins. Keeps players engaged without draining their balance too quickly. (e.g., many small line wins).

High Volatility: Infrequent but very large wins (e.g., big jackpots or bonus rounds). Creates excitement and "big win" stories.

Design: Jili/PG games masterfully mix both. They use small, frequent wins to maintain player balance and anticipation, punctuated by the potential for high-volatility features.

3. The Reel-Strip Model: Weighted Reels
The visual reels are not what they seem. Each reel is a virtual "strip" with symbols placed in a specific, weighted order.

Concept: Instead of each symbol having an equal chance, each position on each virtual reel is assigned a specific symbol based on its weight.

Example:

A low-paying symbol (e.g., Cherry) might have a weight of 100.

A high-paying symbol (e.g., 'A') might have a weight of 50.

The Wild symbol might have a weight of 20.

The Scatter symbol might have a weight of 5.

Process on Spin:

The RNG generates a series of numbers (one for each reel).

The game engine consults the weighted table for Reel 1. It adds up all the weights (e.g., 1000 total) and uses the first RNG number to "land" on a position. A number between 1-100 might land on a Cherry, 101-150 on an 'A', etc.

This is repeated for all 5 reels (or however many your game has).

The final set of symbols is what is displayed on the screen. The animation is just a fancy effect that stops on this pre-determined outcome.

4. The Paying Logic: Line Wins and Ways-to-Win
Paylines: Traditional lines (e.g., 20 lines). The game checks each active line for matching symbols from left to right.

Ways-to-Win (e.g., 243 Ways): This is very common in Jili/PG games. A win is achieved by landing matching symbols on adjacent reels starting from the leftmost reel (Reel 1). You don't need them on a specific line.

Logic: For each symbol type, the game checks Reel 1 for any instance of that symbol. For each found, it checks Reel 2 for the same symbol, and so on. The total number of ways is the product of the number of that symbol on each reel (reel1_count * reel2_count * reel3_count...).

5. The "Magic" Behind the Scenes: Outcome First, Animation Second
This is a critical architectural point.

Calculate Outcome: The game uses the RNG and the weighted reels to determine the entire spin outcome the instant you press spin. It knows if it's a win, a loss, or if it will trigger a bonus before any animation happens.

Trigger Animations: The spinning animation, the sound effects, the anticipationâ€”all of it is theater designed to make the predetermined outcome feel exciting and random.

Bonus Triggers: The game knows it has landed, for example, 3 Scatter symbols. It will then play a special animation to "reveal" them, even though the outcome was already set.

6. Advanced Profit & Engagement Logic
Near Misses: The RNG and reel strips can be designed to make "near misses" (e.g., two scatters and the third just off-screen) occur more often than pure probability would suggest. This psychologically encourages players to spin again.

Bonus Game Triggers: The frequency of entering the bonus round is precisely calculated based on RTP. The bonus round itself has its own internal RTP and logic, often using a different set of weighted tables or a pick-and-click mechanic with guaranteed total value.

Jackpots (Progressive/Fixed): A small percentage of each bet is added to a progressive jackpot pool. The logic to win this jackpot is usually triggered by a specific, rare combination (e.g., 5 Wilds on a max bet) or by a separate RNG check that has very low probability on each spin.

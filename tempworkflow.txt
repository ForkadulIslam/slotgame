1. Target Win Frequency & Payout Structure
For your game, aim for this structure:

Overall Hit Frequency: ~25-35%. (Meaning about 1 in 3 to 1 in 4 spins results in a win). This is lower than big slots but feels much more frequent due to the next points.

Small Win ("Kepper" wins): ~20-25% of spins. (Pays 0.5x to 3x your bet).

Medium Win: ~5-8% of spins. (Pays 5x to 15x your bet).

Big Win / Feature Trigger: ~1-2% of spins. (Pays 20x+ or triggers free spins).

This means most wins will be small, but the player is teased frequently enough with medium wins and the hope of a big one.



2. How to Adjust Your Code for This
You control this entirely through your REEL_X_STRIP arrays. You need to carefully craft the symbol distribution.

Your Goal: Make the first two reels hit often, but the third reel is the "decision maker" for bigger wins. This creates constant near-misses and anticipation.

Let's redesign your strips for better engagement:

javascript
// REDESIGNED REEL STRIPS FOR BETTER ENGAGEMENT
// Symbols are chosen for their payout. More low-paying symbols = higher frequency.
const REEL_1_STRIP = [
  // Reel 1: VERY HIGH hit frequency. Loaded with low-paying symbols and wilds.
  "cherry", "cherry", "cherry", "cherry", "cherry", "cherry", "cherry",
  "plum", "plum", "plum", "plum", "plum",
  "orange", "orange", "orange",
  "bell", "bell", "bell", // More wilds on first reel -> more potential
  "lemon", "lemon", // Lemon is a low-paying, "non-winning" symbol for this reel
  "banana", // Banana is a blank
  // FEWER high-tier symbols here
  "bar",
  "seven",
  "melon",
];

const REEL_2_STRIP = [
  // Reel 2: HIGH hit frequency. Similar to reel 1.
  "cherry", "cherry", "cherry", "cherry", "cherry",
  "plum", "plum", "plum", "plum",
  "orange", "orange", "orange",
  "bell", "bell", // Wilds
  "lemon", "lemon", "lemon",
  "banana", "banana",
  // A few more mid/high tiers than reel 1
  "bar", "bar",
  "seven",
  "melon", "melon",
];

const REEL_3_STRIP = [
  // Reel 3: The "Decision" reel. This is where wins are made or broken.
  // FEWER low-paying symbols means fewer overall wins, but bigger ones.
  "cherry", "cherry", "cherry", // Fewer cherries
  "plum", "plum",
  "orange", "orange",
  "bell", // FEWER wilds -> makes winning harder
  "lemon", "lemon", "lemon", "lemon", "lemon", // More "non-winning" symbols
  "banana", "banana", "banana", "banana", // More blanks
  // BUT, when a high-tier symbol lands, it's more valuable.
  // PACK the high-paying symbols together. This creates "clusters".
  "bar", "bar", "bar", // Cluster of bars
  "seven", "seven",    // Cluster of sevens
  "melon", "melon", "melon", // Cluster of melons
];
Why this works:

Reels 1 & 2 will show winning symbols (cherry, plum, orange, bell) very often, creating excitement at the start of the spin.

Reel 3 has many "non-winning" symbols (lemon, banana). This means the exciting start from reels 1 & 2 will often result in a "heart-breaking" near-miss on reel 3, which is highly engaging.

However, Reel 3 is also clustered with high-value symbols. When one of these does hit, it will often be part of a big win (because it's likely to match the good symbol already on reels 1 & 2).

1. Target Win Frequency & Payout Structure
For your game, aim for this structure:

Overall Hit Frequency: ~25-35%. (Meaning about 1 in 3 to 1 in 4 spins results in a win). This is lower than big slots but feels much more frequent due to the next points.

Small Win ("Kepper" wins): ~20-25% of spins. (Pays 0.5x to 3x your bet).

Medium Win: ~5-8% of spins. (Pays 5x to 15x your bet).

Big Win / Feature Trigger: ~1-2% of spins. (Pays 20x+ or triggers free spins).

This means most wins will be small, but the player is teased frequently enough with medium wins and the hope of a big one.



2. How to Adjust Your Code for This
You control this entirely through your REEL_X_STRIP arrays. You need to carefully craft the symbol distribution.

Your Goal: Make the first two reels hit often, but the third reel is the "decision maker" for bigger wins. This creates constant near-misses and anticipation.
